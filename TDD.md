# Technical Design Document Template

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the design specifications for a program that allows users to convert PlantUML class diagrams into source code files in a selected programming language and vice versa. This document ensures alignment across the development team and stakeholders.

## Introduction
This project aims to create a tool that bridges the gap between visual design (PlantUML class diagrams) and actual code implementation. The tool will support bidirectional conversion, enabling developers to generate code from diagrams or create diagrams from existing code.

- **Project Name:** PlantUML Code Generator
- **Document Author:** @developer
- **Date Created:** 2023-10-01
- **Last Updated:** 2023-10-01
- **Stakeholders:** @project_manager, @lead_developer, @qa_team

## Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:

- [ ] Objective 1: Develop a tool that converts PlantUML class diagrams into source code files in a selected programming language.
- [ ] Objective 2: Develop a tool that generates PlantUML class diagrams from source code files.
- [ ] Objective 3: Ensure the tool supports multiple programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, C++).
- [ ] Objective 4: Provide a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the tool.

## Architecture Diagrams
The architecture of the system is divided into two main components: the PlantUML Parser and the Code Generator.

## Design Details

### Component 1: PlantUML Parser
- **Description:** This component is responsible for parsing PlantUML class diagrams and extracting class definitions, attributes, methods, and relationships.
- **Responsibilities:** 
  - Parse PlantUML syntax.
  - Validate the structure of the PlantUML diagram.
  - Extract relevant information for code generation.
- **Dependencies:** 
  - PlantUML library for parsing.
  - Language-specific templates for code generation.

### Component 2: Code Generator
- **Description:** This component generates source code files based on the parsed PlantUML diagram.
- **Responsibilities:** 
  - Use parsed data to generate code in the selected programming language.
  - Ensure the generated code adheres to the syntax and conventions of the target language.
- **Dependencies:** 
  - Language-specific templates.
  - Parsed data from the PlantUML Parser.

### Component 3: Diagram Generator
- **Description:** This component generates PlantUML class diagrams from source code files.
- **Responsibilities:** 
  - Parse source code files to extract class definitions, attributes, methods, and relationships.
  - Generate PlantUML syntax based on the extracted information.
- **Dependencies:** 
  - Source code parsing libraries (e.g., ANTLR for Java, libclang for C++).
  - PlantUML library for diagram generation.

## Implementation Plan
The implementation will be divided into the following steps:

* **Step 1:** Research and select appropriate libraries for parsing PlantUML and source code.
* **Step 2:** Develop the PlantUML Parser component.
* **Step 3:** Develop the Code Generator component.
* **Step 4:** Develop the Diagram Generator component.
* **Step 5:** Create a user interface for the tool (CLI or GUI).
* **Step 6:** Integrate all components and perform end-to-end testing.
* **Step 7:** Release the tool and gather user feedback.

## Testing Strategies
The following testing strategies will be employed to ensure the tool meets requirements:

- **Unit Testing:** Each component (Parser, Code Generator, Diagram Generator) will be unit tested using frameworks like JUnit (Java) or pytest (Python).
- **Integration Testing:** Components will be tested together to ensure seamless interaction and data flow.
- **Performance Testing:** The tool will be tested for performance, especially when handling large diagrams or codebases.

## Revision History
- `2023-10-01` - Version 1.0
  - @developer: Initial draft created.
- `2023-10-05` - Version 1.1 
  - @developer: Updated component details and added testing strategies.

## Comments and Discussions
- [ ] @project_manager: Request feedback on the implementation plan.
- [ ] @lead_developer: Discuss potential challenges in parsing source code for multiple languages.
- [ ] @qa_team: Provide input on testing strategies and tools.
